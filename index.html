<h1>Actual Preface</h1>
<p>Recently, there are numerous extremist organisations creating "truth" websites with emotionally charged language to propagate misinformation. Ironically, these organisations accuse critics for being more "emotional" and "sensitive" (with their "safe zones" /s) than they are. This satirical site serves to mirror and criticise these "truth" websites, using intentionally poor grammar.</p>
