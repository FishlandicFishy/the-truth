<h1>Disclaimer</h1>
<p>This website is a satirical take on the recent proliferation of numerous overly emotional opinionated sites, which has permeated every aspect of our daily lives. Nothing on this site is true. I do not intend to offend any position, nor is this site intended to support any rhetoric, especially any socially disruptive movements and those that violate any laws. The font used for the SVG above is BabelStone Modern, which is available <a href="http://www.babelstone.co.uk/Fonts/Download/BabelStoneModern.ttf">here</a>. Unclear language is <u><span title="underlined">underlined</span></u>.</p>
<p><i>Andrew C. West, also known as Wei An, was a respected Sinologist and the creator of BabelStone (including the font BabelStone Modern). <a href="https://corp.unicode.org/pipermail/unicode/2025-July/011467.html">He has since passed away.</a></i></p>
<h1>Actual Preface</h1>
<p>Recently, there are numerous extremist organisations creating "truth" websites with emotionally charged language to propagate misinformation. Ironically, these organisations accuse critics for being more "emotional" and "sensitive" (with their "safe zones" /s) than they are. This satirical site serves to mirror and criticise these "truth" websites, using intentionally poor grammar.</p>
