# the-truth
A satirical "truth" website. No views are endorsed or intentionally offended.

Recently, there are numerous extremist organisations creating "truth" websites with emotionally charged language to propagate misinformation. Ironically, these organisations accuse critics for being more "emotional" and "sensitive" (with their "safe zones") than they are. This satirical site serves to mirror and criticise these "truth" websites with intentionally poor grammar.
