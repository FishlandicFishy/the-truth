## APPENDIX I: List of references (tried to be exhaustive):
* "Kosaria" = "KOSA" + generic -ria suffix for countries
* Title "Corporations fear a loss in profits and entrepreneurial opportunities" based on an actual news title: "澳洲將禁16歲以下青少年用社交媒體　有企業家憂年輕人失創業機會"
* "Kids' Oxidation Safeguarding Act" = KOSA = Kids Online Safety Act, banning children from accessing most of the Internet
* Pseudoscientific claims parody themselves
* "Hyperoxia-No-More" conference = economic and/or diplomatic conferences
* World Entitled Forum = World Economic Forum
* Kosarius the II's "joke" is a reference to a so-called "joke" during diplomacy: "在峰會後，與領導人舉行會談，兩國領導人互贈禮物。領導人贈送 2 部手機，領導人笑問手機的通訊是否安全，領導人幽默回應「你看看有沒有後門」，令在場人士大笑。這一幕被外界視為領導人在公開場合中少有的輕鬆一刻。"
* "AI-generated video" of the Glorious Leader = "他在社交平台透過AI生成片段，介紹他發表他戴的領呔"
* "John I've Never Heard Of Him, well-known economic expert" = some random "military expert" so unknown you can't even find him online outside of the news report, cited in an actual news article because why not
* "pull themselves up by their bootstraps and stop being so goddamn lazy all the time instead of buying Starfricks every day" almost word-for-word from actual US Republican remarks
* "violent pro-oxygen terrorists (with paper clips)" = Louis Rossmann-led "Clippy" demonstrations using paper clips to signify alignment: "On August 8, 2025, Rossmann uploaded a video encouraging internet users to change their profile pictures to an image of Clippy as a form of silent protest against unethical conduct by technology companies, such as mining personal data for the training of artificial intelligence programs or its sale to data brokers, planned obsolescence, censorship, or the use of ransomware. Clippy, in contrast, was seen by Rossmann as a harmless virtual assistant that only wanted to be helpful." (Wikipedia/Louis Rossmann)
* "announced last-minute that the conference would be postponed, and…" = how the Austin City Council postponed their meeting after Rossmann announced his plans to speak there
* WEF's well-hidden link = some tech company at the Austin City Council getting to speak because they filled in a different form you can't realistically find on their website (NOT actually the World Economic Forum, I just used the same parody name to increase article cohesion)
* "Violent protestors overthrowing the government"… this references too much stuff. It's all the same.
* "Wanted for 67 trillion Kosarian dollars" = protestors being wanted for a large fee
* John Kosa's tirades are word-for-word from actual political tirades, just with keywords replace with Kosaria-appropriate ones
* John Arrogant's tirades are word-for-word from actual governmental posts and from the general public (you can see how bigoted it is)
* John Respiration's family snitching on him = a protestor's family snitching on his location right after hearing about him being a fugitive; also saying "I always knew his character"
* "Climate change is real" = our school's English Speaking exams passing off the mere name-drop of "global warming" as "too scientific" as "this is not a scientific discussion"
* "Crime of Inconsideracy" is real, despite how absurd it sounds
* Kosaria Gambler's Club bribing officials to vote for sports gambling legalisation = another gambling club in another city doing the same, causing basketball gambling to be legalised… for exclusive use by said gambling club. Gotta love monopolisation.
* Shetfrickball = every sport, ever (I say this indiscriminately, all sports are inherently hooliganistic and you can't change my mind)
* "throwing cats and roaches into water reservoirs" = an incident where Buddhists "spread love" by "releasing" thousands of cats and invasive species (including roaches) into water reservoirs, causing many of them to die
* "The crowds of shetfrickball are always so enthusiastic" is analog to what the crowds at said sports games would say, they just don't want to admit that they swear a lot
* "Oh, and an athlete was just knocked unconscious by the ball, so a medic ended the competition. Oh, how dare the medic ruin the competition like that? How dare him??": common sight at boxing. Unconscious boxers rescued by medics are booed.
* "…other regions such as the Current Yugoslavic Republic of South Macedonia and Northeast Virginia have legalised betting of all sports, setting a precedent for Kosaria to follow suit." is a real argument (albeit with different regions) invoked in support of basketball gambling.
* Advertisement parodies an advertisement in the download page of a Kangxi Dictionary-based font (see Appendix II).

### Miscellaneous:
* Cocoberry = Cocomelon
* Skibidi Toilets = Skibidi Toilet (the brainrot series) and the average family-run brand
* Lafufu = Labubu, a fad involving poorly created fursona plushies and unofficial derivatives such as "Labubu Dubai chocolate" or even "Labubu v*pes" (Unintentional irony, but you ought to breathe air instead of carcinogens, you people)
* West Korea = North Korea
* Australia-Hangry = Austria-Hungary
* Current Yugoslavic Republic of South Macedonia = Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia = North Macedonia
* Northeast Virginia = West Virginia

大家好，(OMITTED)免费公益可商用的字体库新增两个非常实用的字体。

此前我们曾发布世界首个首个昆曲专用工尺谱编写的免费公益字体：“(OMITTED)工尺谱字体”，详见：(OMITTED)工尺谱字体

也发布过世界首个免费公益昆曲简谱输入字体，可用于昆曲（及音乐简单的剧种）的简谱编写，详见：(OMITTED)昆曲简谱

以上字体都是可以免费使用，以及商用的，不用担心版权问题。

近日，我们又贡献出一个系列的免费可商用字体——(OMITTED)康熙字典美化体

包括两个子集：

1. (OMITTED)康熙字典美化体正常款（也就是Regular款）：常规使用，各种场景适应性好，尤其适合标题、少量文字的海报等。

2. (OMITTED)康熙字典美化体清瘦款（可以视同Light款）：作为辅助，或应用于重要的正文。


此前，网上有基于康熙字典的字体，康熙字典的字体也是许多文字编辑、平面设计工作者的大爱。不过可惜：其一，网上的康熙字典字体是不可商用的，且当前似乎已不对外提供了；其二，由于康熙字典的雕版古籍，有许多雕版印刷的磨损瑕疵，这些瑕疵一般都没有得到修复（尽管有古朴残缺之美，但是也毕竟与雕版原始字的意图相差甚远）；其三，康熙字典作为繁体字库，有大量简体字是没有的，使用时需要先翻译成繁体字，而且，还有大量常用汉字没有对应繁体，也就是说，是完全不被康熙字典包含的。

我们提供的这套字体，基于康熙字典风格进行美化，有以下特点：

拓展了许多康熙字体没有的字。至少有上百个现代汉语常用字，在康熙字典中是没有的。(OMITTED)创始人杨博士，按照康熙字体的风格，人工生造而成，这样，可以用于许多现代语境的词汇输入，如“甭说”的“甭”、“垃圾”的“垃”、“多肽”的“肽”、“咖啡”的“咖”、甚至我们读者受众多是戏曲爱好者，戏曲中常见的“唢呐”的“唢”、“掭头”的“掭”，等等，大量的字并非繁体简体互换的问题，而是这些字根本就不存在于康熙字典之中。这类字都得到了生造补充。
印刷斑驳噪点充分修复。网上关于古籍的衬线字体，往往存在问题是：雕版印刷斑驳，破损噪点众多，但没有得到修复。我们这个字体对康熙字典进行了的斑驳修复，字体整洁如新。
美化处理：适当加粗美化，更端庄大气，适合字少的场景，比如作为海报标题使用。
美化处理：适当柔化笔触，增加一点点书法风格，弱化了一点康熙字典的金石刀篆风格，看起来更赏心悦目一点。
部分字形不美观的字，重新调整字形。
我们已为用户设置成自动转换繁体，不用再特地将简体转化繁体，直接输入简体，即可显示成康熙字典中对应的繁体字，使用更为方便。
用于诗词类场景（标题为正常款、正文用清瘦款）如下


用于诗词古文竖排场景（标题为正常款、正文用清瘦款）如下


与我们的(OMITTED)工尺谱字体，一起用于抄谱，也非常搭配哦！
